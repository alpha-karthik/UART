# UART Protocol Implementation and Verification

Welcome to the repository for the project on UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) Protocol Implementation and Functional Verification using System Verilog.

## Project Overview

This project centers around the design, implementation, and verification of the UART protocol, a fundamental communication standard used in serial communication between devices. The project covers two main aspects:

1. **RTL Design**: Developing the UART transmitter and receiver modules using Register Transfer Level (RTL) coding in Verilog. This involves creating efficient and accurate modules for data transmission and reception.
2. **Functional Verification**: Leveraging System Verilog and advanced verification methodologies to thoroughly test the UART implementation. Techniques like Constraint Random Coverage-Driven Verification and Assertion-Based Verification will be employed to ensure protocol compliance and robustness.

## Repository Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

- `source_files/`: Contains the Verilog source code for the UART transmitter and receiver modules.
- `test_bench/`: Includes the System Verilog testbench files for functional verification.
- `sim_results/`: Results of simulation runs, waveforms, and coverage reports.
- `LICENSE`: The license governing the use of this project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/alpha-karthik/UART.git`
2. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd UART`
3. Explore the `source_files/` directory for the RTL design and the `test_bench/` directory for the verification environment.
